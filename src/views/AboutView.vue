            <br>
            <br>

            After my formal training as a photographer I spent some time practicing different areas of photography. I initially focused my interest on fashion, to find what I was actually more attracted to and enjoyed was the human element of photography, from the classic pose to the more modern documentary image styles.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was asked by a friend to cover a wedding, I agreed and found a very enjoyable type of photography that allowed me to indulge my artistic flair as well as the technical aspects required.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been a wedding photographer for over seven years and in this time I have been to many locations, throughout the UK. I have been to various venues and wedding ceremonies, from village churches, to town halls to in the middle of a field.
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the past couple of years I have been using a small retro camper van to allow me to pretty much travel anywhere in the UK the evening before a wedding to avoid any travel complications. This started off as a convenient way of being very close to where I needed to be the evening before, this  has now turned into a fun element of the different locations.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having attended more weddings than most, I am quite knowledgeable about the proceedings, from the formal side of the services to the informal fun parts of the day, which vary from wedding to wedding and the individuals.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am confident in my role from being in the industry for years. And I like to think of myself as friendly, approachable, professional and always happy to help.
